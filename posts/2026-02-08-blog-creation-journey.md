- # 🚀 Building a Blazing-Fast Blog with FastHTML and Railway

  *Or: How I Went from Zero to Deployed in One Afternoon*

  ------

  ## The Mission

  I wanted a blog. Not just any blog—a **modern, glassmorphism-styled, lightning-fast** blog that I could actually understand and customize. No WordPress bloat, no JavaScript framework rabbit holes, just pure Python goodness.

  Enter **FastHTML** and **MonsterUI**.

  ------

  ## What We Built

  A full-featured blog with:

  - 🎨 **Apple-inspired glassmorphism** design (because we're fancy like that)
  - 🏷️ **Multi-select tag filtering** with smart AND logic
  - 📝 **Markdown posts** with syntax highlighting
  - 🚀 **Floating navigation** that follows you around
  - 📱 **Fully responsive** (works on your phone, your tablet, your smart fridge)
  - ⚡ **Blazing fast** (no React bloat here!)

  ------

  ## The Tech Stack

  

  Copied!

  ```
  from fasthtml.common import *
  from monsterui.all import *
  from pure_joy import *  # (not a real package, but should be)
  ```

  **FastHTML** - Python all the way down. No template languages, no build steps, just Python functions that spit out HTML. It's like React, but you can actually read it.

  **MonsterUI** - A component library that makes your UI look like it was designed by someone who actually cares. Think shadcn, but for Python.

  **Railway** - Deploy with one command. Seriously. One. Command.

  ```

  ### The Components

  **Layout** - A floating nav that makes you feel like you're browsing on a spaceship:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  def Layout(*children, title="My Blog", wide=False):
      return (
          Title(title),
          Nav(cls="glass-nav rounded-full"),  # ✨ Glass magic
          Container(*children),
          Footer("© 2026 Me. Built with FastHTML.")
      )
  ```

  **PostCard** - Clickable cards with hover effects that would make Apple jealous:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  def PostCard(post: dict):
      return A(
          H3(post['title']),
          P(post['excerpt']),
          Div(*[Span(f"#{tag}") for tag in post['tags']]),
          href=f"/post/{post['slug']}",
          cls="glass-card glass-card-hover"  # Hover goes *whoosh*
      )
  ```

  **FilterSection** - Multi-select tag filtering that actually makes sense:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  def FilterSection(all_tags, selected, enabled):
      # Smart chip states: active, enabled, or disabled
      # No more selecting combinations that return zero results!
      return Div(*[chip(tag) for tag in all_tags])
  ```

  ------

  ## The Glassmorphism Sauce

  The secret ingredient? **CSS backdrop-filter** and a sprinkle of good taste:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  .glass-card {
      background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
      backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
      border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
      box-shadow: 
          0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31, 38, 135, 0.15),
          inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  }
  ```

  Translation: "Make it look like frosted glass with a hint of sci-fi."

  ------

  ## The Deployment Journey

  ### Act 1: The Wrong Folder Incident

  

  Copied!

  ```
  $ cd ~/nbs/fastblog  # WRONG FOLDER
  $ railway up
  # *crickets*
  ```

  **Lesson learned:** Always check `pwd` before deploying. Always.

  ### Act 2: The Port Mystery

  

  Copied!

  ```
  Railway: "What port is your app on?"
  Me: "Uh... yes?"
  ```

  **Solution:** Railway uses the `PORT` environment variable. Update your `serve()`:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  import os
  serve(port=int(os.getenv('PORT', 5001)), host='0.0.0.0')
  ```

  ### Act 3: Success! 🎉

  

  Copied!

  ```
  $ cd ~/nbs/myblog  # RIGHT FOLDER
  $ railway up
  ✓ Deploy complete
  ✓ Healthcheck succeeded!
  ✓ Your blog is LIVE!
  ```

  **Final URL:** `[https://blog-production-da01.up.railway.app`](https://blog-production-da01.up.railway.app`/)

  (Not the prettiest URL, but hey, it's free and it works!)

  ------

  ## The Auto-Deploy Magic

  Connect to GitHub once, never think about deployment again:

  

  Copied!

  ```
  # One-time setup
  railway link --repo username/myblog
  
  # From now on:
  git add .
  git commit -m "New blog post about cats"
  git push origin main
  # ✨ Railway auto-deploys in 2 minutes ✨
  ```

  No CI/CD config. No Docker files. No webpack. Just `git push` and chill.

  ------

  ## The Free Tier Reality Check

  **Railway free tier:**

  - ✅ $5 credit/month
  - ✅ 500 execution hours
  - ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
  - ⚠️ Apps sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity

  **Translation:** Your blog takes a 20-second coffee break if nobody visits for 5 minutes. First visitor wakes it up.

  **Solution:** Use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping your blog every 5 minutes. Free. Easy. Done.

  ------

  ## The FastAI Style Philosophy

  This project follows [fast.ai coding style](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html):

  

  Copied!

  ```
  # ✅ Wildcard imports (controversial, but convenient)
  from fasthtml.common import *
  
  # ✅ Minimal vertical spacing
  def PostCard(post): return A(H3(post['title']), href=f"/post/{post['slug']}")
  
  # ✅ One-line docstrings
  def Layout(*children, title="My Blog"):
      """Main layout with floating nav and footer"""
  ```

  **Philosophy:** Code should be dense but readable. No boilerplate. No ceremony.

  ------

  ## What We Learned

  1. **Python can do HTML** - And it's actually pleasant
  2. **Glassmorphism is easy** - Just blur everything and add transparency
  3. **Deployment should be boring** - Railway makes it so
  4. **Free tier has limits** - But they're totally workable
  5. **Always check your folder** - Seriously. Always.

  ------

  ## The Results

  - ⚡ **Build time:** ~2 minutes
  - 🚀 **Deploy time:** ~2 minutes
  - 💰 **Cost:** $0/month (free tier)
  - 😊 **Fun factor:** 11/10
  - 🐛 **Bugs shipped:** Only the ones we haven't found yet

  ------

  ## Next Steps

  Things I might add (or might not, we'll see):

  - 📡 RSS feed (for the 3 people who still use RSS readers)
  - 🔍 Search functionality (Ctrl+F works for now)
  - 🌙 Dark mode toggle (my eyes hurt at night)
  - 📊 View counter (to see how many bots visit)
  - ✉️ Newsletter signup (to spam... I mean, *engage* with readers)

  ------

  ## The Bottom Line

  **Time invested:** One afternoon
  **Lines of Python:** ~400
  **JavaScript written:** 0
  **Sanity retained:** Mostly
  **Would I do it again:** Absolutely

  ------

  ## Try It Yourself

  

  Copied!

  ```
  # Clone the concept (not my blog, make your own!)
  pip install python-fasthtml monsterui python-frontmatter
  
  # Create your masterpiece
  # main.py, components.py, utils.py, custom.css
  
  # Deploy
  railway login
  railway up
  
  # Profit? (Metaphorically)
  ```

  ------

  ## Final Thoughts

  Building a blog in 2026 shouldn't require a PhD in JavaScript frameworks. With FastHTML and Railway, it doesn't.

  **Python + HTML + CSS + One Command = Blog**

  It's really that simple.

  Now go build something cool. And remember: always check `pwd` before deploying.

  ------

  *Built with FastHTML, MonsterUI, and an unhealthy amount of coffee.*
  *Deployed on Railway (sleeping peacefully between visitors).*
  *Styled with glassmorphism (because regular morphism is so 2020).*

  🚀 **Happy coding!**
